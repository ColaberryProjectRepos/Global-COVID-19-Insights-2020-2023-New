I sift through a plethora of information to identify the most meaningful and relevant indicators. Therefore, choosing the right KPIs necessitates aligning them with the overarching goals and objectives of the project. This alignment is crucial for ensuring that the selected KPIs offer insights that directly contribute to the desired outcomes. The choice of KPIs should be made with a long-term perspective. Therefore, selecting KPIs involves thinking about their relevance and applicability over an extended period. Ensuring that the data source is trustworthy and that it undergoes regular validation and cleansing processes can be a challenging endeavor in itself.<br><br></div><div style="margin: 0px; color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;">2.<strong>Chart Selection:&nbsp;</strong>When dealing with complex and multifaceted datasets, it can be challenging to determine which types of charts will effectively communicate the data's nuances and insights. Selecting charts that are too complex for the audience to interpret can lead to miscommunication, while overly simplistic charts may fail to convey the depth of the data. Effective data visualization is about telling a compelling story with data. Selecting charts that support the narrative you want to convey can be challenging, especially when the story is multifaceted and requires multiple visualizations. It involves a thoughtful evaluation of data characteristics, audience needs, storytelling objectives, and design considerations.<br><br></div><div style="margin: 0px; color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;">3.<strong>Continent table in the data dictionary:&nbsp;</strong>Establishing a Continent Table in the Data Dictionary: The initial dataset lacked information regarding the continental categorization of countries, posing a challenge in depicting the distribution of COVID-19 cases by continent. Finding a pre-existing continent table that precisely matched the country list within my dataset proved to be a complex task. As a result, I encountered instances where manual entry of continent names next to certain countries was necessary, given that the original dataset included regions that are not conventionally regarded as independent countries, often representing islands or territories.<br><br></div><div style="margin: 0px; color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;"><strong>4. Meeting Stringent Client Data Presentation Requirements:&nbsp;</strong>I was tasked with aligning my data presentation precisely with the specific requirements of my client, which posed a significant challenge due to the nature of the dataset. I dedicated a substantial amount of time, spanning several days, to comprehensively analyze and strategize how best to fulfill the clientâ€™s exact expectations. Ultimately, through meticulous effort, help from my team, and problem-solving, I successfully achieved the desired outcome.</div><div style="margin: 0px; color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px; color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;"><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1430/4/1.jpg" style="width: 602px; height: 337.057px;"><br></div>
